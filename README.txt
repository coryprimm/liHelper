liHelper: A Chrome Plugin for Effortless Job Searching

liHelper is a Chrome plugin designed to enhance your job search experience by automatically removing job listings you've already applied to from your search results.

Compatibility

This plugin has been tested and verified to work seamlessly with Chrome Version 116.0.5845.187.

Bugs: Currently the script is running outside li, which causes slowdowns on other urls. Recommended to only use while you are in LI and otherwise 
navigate to 'chrome://extensions/' and remove it or flip it off.
