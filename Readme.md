# liHelper: A Chrome Plugin for Streamlined Job Searching

liHelper is a Chrome plugin designed to elevate your job search experience by automatically removing job listings you've already applied to from your search results.

## Compatibility

This plugin has been rigorously tested and verified to seamlessly integrate with Chrome Version 116.0.5845.187.

## Known Issue

Currently, the script runs beyond the li domain, potentially causing performance slowdowns on other websites. To ensure optimal performance, it is recommended to use liHelper exclusively while you are on the li platform. 

If you encounter any issues on other websites or wish to temporarily disable the plugin, simply navigate to 'chrome://extensions/' and either remove it or disable it from there.
